<ins>String delimeter</ins>: A string delimiter is a character used to mark the beginning and/or end of a string.

1. In string variables it stops execution if encounters '\0'. However whitespace characters like: **space (' '), null('\0') tab ('\t') or newline ('\n')** are treated as regular character.

> # **```Subsequence```**

The subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting one or more or no character without changing the actual order of the characters.

For example, the sequence 1,2,3,4 has the following subsequences:

```cpp
1,2,3  
2,3,4  
1,3,4  
1,2,4  
1,2  
2,3  
3,4  
1  
2  
3  
4  
```
