Using single directional two pointers, we can calculate the sum. To adding up to the sum we will use the left pointer ``i`` to traverse toward right.
Here there must be two cases:

1. If sum is similar to ``k`` then we will calculate the subarray size.
2. Whenever the sum exceeds the ``k`` we have to rearrange
