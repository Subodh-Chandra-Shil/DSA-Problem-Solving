> # Operating System

---
What components are required to run an application in any computer or computation power-based machine?  

* CPU
* GPU
* Disk
* Memory

Any application running without an OS will capture all resources mentioned above. Thus, this situation will create a problematic scenario that will refrain other applications from running and sharing these resources in parallel. This can only be achieved by getting the OS layer.

OS will maintain the resources in which the application actually needs to run successfully and in what amount the resources should distribute if there is multiple application running at a time.

**OS is a like an interface**

## Benefits of having OS

1. OS automatically handle resources, thus a developer don't need to explicitly handle resources which can save a lot developing time, complexity, save the application being bulky.
