 * Easy Questions: Think 30-45 minutes (may vary)
    ^ Go for hints
    ! Go for solutions
 * Medium Questions: Think 45-60 minutes (may vary)
    ^ Go for hints
    ! Go for solutions

~ Approach for inteview:
    * Explain the bruteforce (complexity doesn't matter at all), just explain your thoughts and intuition, don't code in bruteforce not until interview say so.
    * Opt optimization using algorithms, or any other way to solve
    * Always explain what you thought
    * Your solution should have proper comments
    * Explain time and space complexity
    * Implement formating guidelines

^ How to practice:
    * Try to solve 4-6 problems a day
    * Always participates in the contest
    * Make a blog, or any other online way to express your solutinos, that can add up to your resume
    * Every 3 day wise you should revise at least 3-5 previous problems
        * First of all, try yourself without taking help from any hints
        * Optimize previous solution or make important changes to your previous codebase
