# ```Time Complexity```

### **What is time complexity?**  
<ins>Myth buster</ins>: Time taken by an algorithm isn't time complexity.  
Time complexity is a mathematical approach to compute how an algorithm will behave overtime as input grows. So, it is a mathematical notation to indicate hypothetical time consumption as per more input add on.

### **So why don't we just mesaure time complexity in more human readable unit forms like cm, km etc?**

> Because the resources of each machine differs. Even if, we have same configuration of machines but it still can shows different time consumption to execute an algorithm. Meanwhile, different algorithms are not tend to compared for mesauring performance distinction. Performance still can acheived by enriching machine configuration. But it is most important to validate an algorithm is that futureproof if a huge overload of input occurs.
