# ```Recursion```

**<ins>Definition</ins>**: When a function calls itself until a specific condition is met to terminate the function call process.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Stack overflow or segmentation fault</strong></summary>

    1. Due to conditional check fails it could cause infinite recursive call. In the process, the internal stack filled up with a large amount of function calls which will eventually exceeds the limit of internal stack space.

    2. Stack overflow causes segmentation fault.

<ins>**Base Condition**</ins>: The condition that checks for whether the recursive call should be stopped. &nbsp;
