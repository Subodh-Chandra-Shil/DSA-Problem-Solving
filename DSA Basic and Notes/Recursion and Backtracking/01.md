# ```Recursion```

### <ins>**Definition**</ins>: When a function calls itself until a specific condition is met to terminate the function call process

&nbsp;

## **Stack overflow or segmentation fault**

    (1) Due to conditional check fails it could cause infinite recursive call.
    In the process, the internal stack filled up with a large amount of function calls which will eventually exceeds the limit of internal stack space.

    (2) Stack overflow causes segmentation fault.

## **Base Condition**

 The condition that checks for whether the recursive call should be stopped. &nbsp;

## **Recursive Tree**

Visual representation of recursive calls in a tree like diagram.

## **Backtracking**

The last function call executed first  
Print line must execute after the function call
