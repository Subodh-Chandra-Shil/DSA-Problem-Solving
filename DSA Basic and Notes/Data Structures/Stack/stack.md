> # **```Stack```**

LIFO **(Last In First Out)**  

<ins>**Push**</ins>: Insert an element from last of the stack.  
<ins>**Pop**</ins>: Remove an element from last of the stack.  
<ins>**Peek**</ins>: To see the top element or last element.  

1. Stack can be implemented by array. In this case, an index poniter **top** will be initialized with value -1.
2. Size of the stack is top + 1.
3. If, top iterator value is -1 then the stack is empty.
