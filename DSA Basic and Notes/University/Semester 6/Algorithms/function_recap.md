## <p align="center"><b>Functions role in algorithms</b></p>

1. Divide complexity into various minimal parts, thus work around those smaller portion make the algorithm to maintain DRY **(Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle and debug easily.
2. Algorithms expressed

Two types of function are seen in C and C++, these are:

1. **Built-in function**: C and C++ has many built in functions and methods (as for C++ STL) to reduce boilerplate and redundancy. Many popular algorithms are also written if form of built-in library function.

2. **User defined function**: Also known as sub-routines. Meanwhile, programmers construct . Here is three parts of user defined functions:
    - Function decleration
    - Function call
    - Function definition
