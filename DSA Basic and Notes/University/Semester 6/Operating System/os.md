## **What is an operating system**?

An operating is an interface between computer hardware and the end user. It is a medium to communicate with the computer and instruct the computer hardawares without knowing complex computer language.

<ins>**Operating system manages:**</ins>

1. Hardware resources of a computer.
2. Provides a place or platform to run various application.

<ins>**Goals of an operating system:**</ins>

1. User friendly
2. Efficiency

<ins>**Characteristics:**</ins>

1. Process management
2. Memory management
3. File management
4. Security management
5. Error defection
6. User defection
7. User interface
8. Resource management

### **What is job**?

Job refers to complete unit of work or instructions that a computer receives and execute accordingly.

From a complete instruction to end of execution.

## **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**

### <p align="center"><b>1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)</b></p>

This algorithm obeys **FIFO (First in First Out)** manner where any <ins>process that arrives first, will eventually get execute first.</ins>

FCFS is a non-preemptive algorithm which halt all other processes until current priority process is not entirely finished.

### **Terms**

<ins>**Arrival time:**</ins>  At which time a process enters to the ready queue.  

<ins>**Brust time:**</ins> The amount of time it consumed by a process to accomplish.

<ins>**Gantt chart:**</ins> It is a visual representation of the execution schedule that displays the start and end time of each process.  

<ins>**Completion time:**</ins> Completion Time is the moment when the process in the Gantt chart was terminated.  

<ins>**Average waiting time (WT):**</ins>

<ins>**Trun around time:**</ins> Completion time - arrival time


How the algorithm works:

1. It picks up the process which is arrived first, (arrival time will lesser). **If the arrival time is similar then pick the process which appears first in the table or ready queue**.
2.
