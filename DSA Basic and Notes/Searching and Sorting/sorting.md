Merge sort has a better time compleixty as compared other popular.
Time complexity of merge sort is O(N log N)
The algorithm that costructs the algorithm is 'Divide and Conquer' or 'Divide and Merge' algorithm.

**Phase 1**: Divide the array until it become an individual single element.

**Phase 2**:
