/*
s1.find(s2) != string::npos

The line return s1.find(s2) != string::npos; checks if s2 is a substring of s1. The find() method on s1 searches for the first occurrence of s2 in s1. If the find() method returns a non-negative value, then the first occurrence of s2 is at that index. Otherwise, the find() method returns string::npos, which is a constant value that indicates that s2 was not found in s1.
