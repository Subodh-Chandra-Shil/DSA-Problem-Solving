> # **```Linked List```**

1. Linked list is a linear data structure that has a collection of nodes.
2. Usually the node consist of two fields, data field and link field to store next node's address.

### **Why?**

1. Changing the size at run time. So, no memory wastage.
    - C++ vector doesn't change size at run time. Rather it creates new array internally and copy the previous value to the new array.
2. Deletion in linked list is easier since we don't need to shift remaining element on it's left.
3. Insertion at any position isn't costly as array.
