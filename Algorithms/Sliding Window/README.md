## Sliding Window 
<ins>**The sliding window itself a pre-computational technique**</ins> to overcome repetational computation. The "window" here used to represent a portion or sub-array of the actual array.

## Identify the pattern
> The algorithm is applicable to contiguous data structures like **Array** and **String**. Since the algorithm works with continuous part of an array or string, so the question that has such keyword like **'subarray'**, **'substring'**, **'largest'**, **'minimum'** and an extra variable such as **'k'** refers the window size or target, indicates this pattern.

### The refers to the subarray size.

## Variants of sliding window algorithm
1. Fix sized window: The window size will be provided.
2. Variable size window: We ourself have to determine the window size.

## **Observation**: Sliding Window vs Kadane's Algorithm
