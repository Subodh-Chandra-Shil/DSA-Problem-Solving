> # **```Bit Manipulation```**

## What are bits?
> 0 and 1, namely bits or binary digits, are the only two digits that a computer can understand. When humans use computers, they typically use the decimal number system. However, computers do not inherently understand the decimal or any other number system except for the binary number system. This is where bit manipulation comes into play. Bit manipulation utilizes properties and algorithms of number system conversions to translate values from other number systems into binary values.

Benefits:
1. Bit manipulation is faster in nature. 
2. 

### Left shifting a number by one (>>) is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = (a >> 1);
cout << b << endl;
```
