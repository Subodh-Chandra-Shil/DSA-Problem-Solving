> # **```Time Complexity```**

> "The time complexity of an algorithm estimates how much time the algorithm will use for some input. The idea is to represent the efficiency as a function whose parameter is the size of the input. By calculating the time complexity, we can find out whether the algorithm is fast enough without implementing it."

**Best case scenario**: Suppose we're finding an element 'x' in an array. The best case scenario is the element can be found in first index. So, algorithm runs for 1 iteration.  

**Worst case scenario**: Finding element 'x' but it isn't in the array. So algorithm runs for iterations similar to the size of the array, still can't find the element.

In time complexity we determine an algorithm be good by it's worst scenario. Like how the algorithm will perform or behave in immense amount of input. The performance is simply how much steps it requires to run the algorithm. The more step it requires the more the algorithm is inefficient.
