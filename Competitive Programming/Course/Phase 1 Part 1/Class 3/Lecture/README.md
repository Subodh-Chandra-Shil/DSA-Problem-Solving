# ```Time complexity of recursive algorithm```

> Master theorem: 

# ```Space complexity of recursive algorithm```

> Space complexity of a recursive algorithm determined by **total number of function calls piled in the implicit memory stack**. 

> It can also be determined by recursive tree visualization, which says space complexity of a recursive algorithm is the **maximum depth multiplied by the space complexity of each node**. 

# ```Memoization```

It's all about saving results of duplicate function calls occurrences and invoke later on if needed.

# ```Generate subsequences```
