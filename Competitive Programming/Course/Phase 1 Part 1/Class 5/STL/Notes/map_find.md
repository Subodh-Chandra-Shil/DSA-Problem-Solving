These two lines of code are both checking if a given key (sum) exists in a std::unordered_map container (preSumMap) using the find() method, but they are checking for opposite conditions.

**The first line of code:**

```
if (preSumMap.find(sum) == preSumMap.end()) {
    // Key `sum` is not found in the map
}
```

checks if the find() method returns the end() iterator of the preSumMap container, which indicates that the key sum is not found in the map. <ins>**In other words, this code block will only be executed if preSumMap does not contain an entry with the key sum.**</ins>

**The second line of code:**

```
if (preSumMap.find(sum) != preSumMap.end()) {
    // Key `sum` is found in the map
}
```

checks if the find() method returns an iterator that is not the end() iterator of the preSumMap container, which indicates that the key sum is found in the map. <ins>**In other words, this code block will only be executed if preSumMap contains an entry with the key sum.</ins>**

So, the main difference between these two lines of code is the condition being checked. The first line checks if the key is not found in the map, while the second line checks if the key is found in the map.
