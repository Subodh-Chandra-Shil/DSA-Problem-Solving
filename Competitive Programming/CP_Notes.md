1. GCD of any even number and 2 is **greater than 1**.
2. Find substring in a string:
   ```cpp
   string_identifier.find(b) != a.npos
   ```
   or,
   ```cpp
   string_identifier.find(b) != -1
   ```
3. Relation between, GCD and LCM is,
   ```cpp
    a x b = gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b)
   ```


### Be careful of keywords like 'at most' in the question description. You don't need to do exact 'n' tasks strictly if it is mentioned with keyword 'at most'. 

### **```Manhattan distance```**


### **```Prime divisor```**

Prime factor is finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number. In prime factorization, keep going finding factor until all the factors become prime number only.  
For example, 100 = 10 x 10 = (5 x 2) x (5 x 2)
2 prime divisors, 5 and 2

১ এর বড় যেকোনো number কে prime factorization হিসেবে দেখানো যাবে । 

### **GCD of more than 2 numbers**
GCD is multiple of common factors

### n % x = rem < x 
কোন সংখ্যা, n কে, x দ্বারা mod করলে remainder সবসময় 0 থেকে x - 1 এর মধ্যেই হবে ।
