1. GCD of any even number and 2 is **greater than 1**.
2. Find substring in a string:
   ```cpp
   string_identifier.find(b) != a.npos
   ```
   or,
   ```cpp
   string_identifier.find(b) != -1
   ```
3. Relation between, GCD and LCM is,
   ```cpp
    a x b = gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b)
   ```


### Be careful of keywords like 'at most' in the question description. You don't need to do exact 'n' tasks strictly if it is mentioned with keyword 'at most'.
