> # **```Rules of approaching fast```**

1. Always start with constructing the bruteforce solution.
2. Always create your own testcase on the first place.
3. Think about edge cases and create testcases on the basis of edge cases. 
4. Time maintain your problem.

## 

1. Read the problem statement thoroughly. Try to understand what the problem is asking you to do.
2. Don't be obsessed with the problem statement story, go through the problem statement. Try to observe testcase and expected output.
3. Identify the key information, constraints, and requirements.
4. Break the problem down into smaller parts or subproblems.
5. Pay attention to input-output limitations and samples provided in the statement.
6. Analyze the sample test cases and try to understand the problem better.
7. Check out the notes section of the problem statement. It may contain some useful information.
8. **Dry run**: Use pen and paper to draw stuff to better understand the problem.
9. If you are still confused, try to read the problem statement again.

## **```Subarray, Subsequence```** 
**Subsequence**: Total number of subsequence in a string or array = $2^n$
**Subset**: Distinct elements, doesn't matter the actual sequence.
